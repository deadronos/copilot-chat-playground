**Date:** 2026-01-24
**Status:** Draft

## Summary
Add concise guidance documents under `docs/agents/redvsblue` describing how Red vs Blue works across UI, engine, rendering, workers, and telemetry. Update `AGENTS.md` to point to the folder for pattern reference.

## Scope
- New docs: overview, engine/simulation, rendering/workers, telemetry/stores, UI/components.
- Update `AGENTS.md` guidance section.

## Non-Goals
- Changing runtime behavior or adding new features.
- Updating telemetry schemas or engine logic.

## Validation
- Docs render in plain markdown and point to current file paths.
- `AGENTS.md` directs agents to `/docs/agents/redvsblue`.
