# Contributing & Feedback — GitHub Copilot CLI 🤝

This project is in an early preview stage. The maintainers welcome issues, discussions, and feedback.

How to give feedback

- From the CLI: run `/feedback` inside the interactive Copilot session to submit a confidential feedback survey.
- GitHub Issues: open an issue at [github/copilot-cli](https://github.com/github/copilot-cli/issues).
- Discussions: join the repository Discussions to suggest features or ask broader questions.

Contributing code

- Fork the repository and submit a PR with a clear description of the change and tests if applicable.
- Follow any contribution or code style guidelines in the repository. If in doubt, open an Issue to discuss the change before implementing.

Development notes

- Keep your local CLI up to date during iterative development; features change rapidly in preview.
- If you plan to run or modify the MCP server or custom agents, add configuration under `~/.copilot/mcp-config.json`.
