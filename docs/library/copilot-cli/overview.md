# Overview — GitHub Copilot CLI 🔭

GitHub Copilot CLI brings the GitHub Copilot coding agent to your terminal, enabling natural-language interaction, code generation, refactoring, debugging, and automation directly where you work.

Key features

- Terminal-native developer experience: ask the agent to inspect, change, or explain code without switching contexts.
- GitHub-integrated: works with your GitHub repos, issues, and PRs when authenticated.
- Agentic workflows: the CLI can run multi-step plans and execute safe actions with your approval.
- Extensible with MCP servers: uses MCP for server-side capabilities and supports custom MCP server configurations.
