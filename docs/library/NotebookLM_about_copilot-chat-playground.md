17 sources
The provided sources introduce the GitHub Copilot SDK, a new tool that allows developers to integrate advanced AI agentic workflows into any application. This technology serves as a programmable layer that can plan tasks, modify files, and execute commands, essentially embedding the power of the Copilot CLI into custom software. Developers can utilize the SDK across multiple languages including Node.js, Python, and Go, leveraging its ability to manage LLM inference and authentication through a JSON-RPC communication loop. Practical applications and community projects, such as the Copilot Chat Playground, demonstrate how to use these tools to build local chat interfaces and streaming AI services. Overall, the documentation highlights how the SDK simplifies the creation of complex AI agents by handling the underlying infrastructure, permissions, and model management.
