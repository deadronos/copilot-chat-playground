# Project Description
We are building a playground for experimenting with GitHub Copilot Chat using the Copilot SDK. This project includes a frontend interface, a backend server, and integration with the Copilot SDK to facilitate interactive chat sessions with AI assistance.

## AGENTS.md
Also look at '.github/copilot-instructions.md' for overall instructions given to the AI agent.

## Agents in Copilot Chat Playground
We have potential agent/subagents to execute in '.github/agents/' folder.
Nonexhaustive list:
- '.github/agents/code-review-subagent.agent.md': An agent specialized in performing code reviews on provided code snippets.
- '.github/agents/planning-subagent.agent.md': An agent focused on planning tasks and organizing information effectively.
- '.github/agents/implement-subagent.agent.md': An agent dedicated to implementing features or code based on given requirements.

## Library Documentation

### Copilot SDK Notes

We compiled documentation for using the Copilot SDK in the 'docs/library/copilot-sdk/' directory. This includes guides on installation, streaming events, tool definitions, system messages, architecture suggestions, and logging practices.

### Copilot CLI Notes

We also have notes for using the Copilot CLI in 'docs/library/copilot-cli/'. This covers installation, authentication, command usage, configuration, and troubleshooting.

### Additional Resources
If you feel something is missing or could be improved, consider proposing additional folders with structured notes in /docs/library folder.
