Premise: a compact 2D pixel RPG called "Clockwork Cores" where a tinkerer-AI (Copilot) explores deterministic, modular dungeons to recover stolen AI cores, using turn-based movement, gadgets, dialogue and light crafting; encounters combine combat, environment puzzles, and hacking minigames so planning and reasoning matter. Interface and rules: the game is grid-based and fully-observable to the agent via a JSON state each turn (map viewport, entities with ids/HP/status, inventory, quest flags, available actions list, and RNG seed), and the agent responds with one of a small, fixed action tokens (move_n/move_s/move_e/move_w/interact/hack/craft:<recipe>/use:<item>/talk:<id>/wait); all mechanics are deterministic given the seed so Copilot can simulate outcomes. Objectives and evaluation: primary goal recover N cores, secondary quests and crafting unlocks; score by turns, cores, side-quests; provide short scripted scenarios (tutorial, trap puzzle, negotiation, multi-room planning) to benchmark Copilot’s planning, exploration, and long-horizon decision-making.
