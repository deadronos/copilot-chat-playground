# Milestones Report (generated 2026-01-23)

> Historical snapshot: this report reflects repository status on 2026-01-23. Streaming and chat session context were implemented later; for the current backend flow see `src/backend/src/controllers/chatController.ts`, `memory/designs/DES006-milestone-c-streaming.md`, and `memory/designs/DES027-chat-session-context-hardening.md`.

**Summary:** Milestone F (Copilot SDK migration) is implemented, tested, and documented. The project has strong coverage for Milestones A/B/D/F. The remaining open work is Milestone C (end-to-end streaming from Copilot → backend → frontend) and Milestone E (workspace access / mounting). See mapped issues and recommended next steps below. ✅⚠️

## Open GitHub Issues

- #4 — **Milestone C — End-to-end streaming (real stdout streaming)** (open)
  - Goal: stream Copilot stdout live into the UI (chunked fetch / SSE), support aborts, and show/export structured logs.
  - Status: OPEN — backend currently buffers Copilot responses (Milestone B behavior). Frontend already has streaming UI support and Copilot service (SDK) supports structured events internally.

- #2 — **Milestone E — Workspace access (optional)** (open)
  - Goal: mount `./workspace` into Copilot container (`/workspace`) and run with `WORKDIR /workspace` (read-only by default) so prompts can reference repo files.
  - Status: OPEN — no docker-compose/service mount or workspace handling implemented yet.

## Milestone-by-Milestone Status

- Milestone A — UI only (fake streaming)
  - Status: **Done** ✅
  - Evidence: `src/frontend/src/components/chat-playground.tsx` (streaming UI state, mode selector), frontend tests and UI states implemented.

- Milestone B — Real Copilot (non-streaming)
  - Status: **Done** ✅
  - Historical evidence: `src/backend/src/index.ts` called `COPILOT_SERVICE_URL` and buffered response; `src/copilot` service responded to `/chat` (buffered), unit/integration tests present.

- Milestone C — End-to-end streaming (real stdout streaming)
  - Status: **Partially done / OPEN** ⚠️
  - Current state:
    - Frontend: streaming UI implemented (appends chunks). See `chat-playground.tsx`.
    - Copilot service: SDK-based implementation (`@github/copilot-sdk`) provides structured streaming internally (DES004/TASK004).
    - Backend at report time: still performed buffered calls (awaited full result and returned plain text). See `src/backend/src/index.ts`.
  - Missing acceptance criteria:
    - Backend proxying of streaming chunks (chunked responses or SSE to browser)
    - Abort support (frontend AbortController → backend and copilot service handling)
    - Structured log streaming & export in UI
  - Next steps:
    1. Design and add a streaming endpoint on backend (chunked `text/plain` or SSE) that proxies Copilot SDK deltas.
    2. Update copilot service to expose streaming (if necessary) or expose streaming via EventBus/SSE.
    3. Add abort handling end-to-end (frontend AbortController → backend → SDK session abort).
    4. Add integration tests and a test harness for streaming behavior and aborts.

- Milestone D — Safety toggles & UX polish
  - Status: **Done** ✅
  - Evidence: UI mode selector present and backend/copilot service accept `mode` (`explain-only` / `project-helper`). Tests check mode behavior.

- Milestone E — Workspace access (optional)
  - Status: **Not started / OPEN** ⚠️
  - Missing work:
    - `docker-compose` or container run config that mounts `./workspace` into the Copilot container
    - Workdir handling and guardrails (read-only mount, safety notes)
    - Tests or examples showing prompts referencing workspace files
  - Next steps:
    1. Add `docker-compose.yml` dev config with an optional `./workspace:/workspace` mount (read-only by default).
    2. Add guardrail documentation and tests verifying file visibility.

- Milestone F — Switch to Copilot SDK (optional)
  - Status: **Done** ✅
  - Evidence: `src/copilot/src/copilot-sdk.ts`, `DES004`, `TASK004` indicate full migration; `@github/copilot-sdk` added to `package.json`, `MIGRATION_SUMMARY.md` documents migration; unit tests added and passing. Remaining: manual verification using a valid `GH_TOKEN` to confirm end-to-end with live API (see TASK004 manual verification items).

## Other notes / lower-priority items

- Lint: There are a couple of pre-existing lint items noted during implementation (TASK004). Consider adding a small lint pass.
- CI & integration: Add E2E tests for streaming behavior once streaming endpoints implemented. Consider adding a CI job that runs integration tests against a recorded or mocked SDK session to avoid requiring real tokens for CI.

---

## Recommended next actions (priority order)

1. Implement Milestone C (streaming) — High priority
   - Add streaming proxy on backend (SSE or chunked response)
   - Wire SDK EventBus to stream deltas to backend → browser
   - Add abort support and integration tests

2. Manual verification for Milestone F — Medium priority
   - Run Copilot service with real `GH_TOKEN` locally and validate streaming, session behavior, and logs
   - Exercise CLI fallback too

3. Implement Milestone E (workspace access) — Medium priority (optional)
   - Add `docker-compose.yml` with optional `./workspace` mount
   - Add docs and guardrails (read-only default)

4. Add streaming E2E tests and CI job that can run in a tokenless way (mocks/fake SDK or recorded sessions)

If you'd like, I can:

1. Create a task file in `memory/tasks/` for Milestone C with a TDD plan + checklist, and start implementing the backend streaming endpoint and tests (Red → Green → Refactor). 🔧

2. Add a `docker-compose.yml` draft for Milestone E and a short safety checklist (read-only by default). 🔒
